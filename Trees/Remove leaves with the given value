//Given a binary tree root and an integer target, delete all the leaf nodes with value target.

Note that once you delete a leaf node with value target, if its parent node becomes a leaf node and has the value target, it should also be deleted (you need to continue doing that until you cannot).


class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* removeLeafNodes(TreeNode* root, int target) {
       if(root==NULL){
           return NULL;
       } 
       if(root!=NULL && root->left==NULL && root->right==NULL && root->val==target){
           return NULL;
       }
       root->left=removeLeafNodes(root->left, target);
       root->right=removeLeafNodes(root->right, target);
       if(root!=NULL && root->left==NULL && root->right==NULL && root->val==target){
           return NULL;
